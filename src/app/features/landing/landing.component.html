          <p>
            The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal
            data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and

          <h4>Responsible Party Notice</h4>

          <p>
            The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or

            Unless a specific storage period has been specified within this
            privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the
            purpose for data processing ceases to apply. If you assert a
            legitimate request for deletion or revoke consent to data
            processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally
            permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or
            commercial retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will
            take place after these reasons cease to apply.
          </p>

          <h4>
            General Notes on Legal Bases for Data Processing on This Website
          </h4>
          <p>
            If you have given your consent to data processing, we process your
            personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO or Art. 9
            para. 2 lit. a DSGVO, if special categories of data according to
            Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO are processed. In the event of express consent
            to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing
            is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO. If you have consented
            to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device
            (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally
            based on § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.
            If your data is necessary for the performance of a contract or for
            the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data
            on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO. Furthermore, we process
            your data if it is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO. Data processing may also be based on
            our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.
            The relevant legal bases for data processing in each individual case
            are provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
          </p>

          <h4>Recipients of Personal Data</h4>
          <p>
            In the course of our business activities, we cooperate with various
            external entities. It is sometimes necessary to transfer personal
            data to these external entities. We only pass on personal data to
            external entities if it is necessary for the fulfillment of a
            contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of
            data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant
            to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO in the disclosure, or if another
            legal basis permits the data transfer. When using data processors,
            we only transfer personal data of our customers based on a valid
            data processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint
            processing agreement is concluded.
          </p>

          <h4>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h4>
          <p>
            Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
            consent. You can revoke consent that has already been given at any
            time. The legality of the data processing carried out before the
            revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct
            Marketing (Art. 21 DSGVO)

              PARTICULAR SITUATION, AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
              PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE
              PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS

          <h4>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Supervisory Authority</h4>
          <p>
            In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right
            to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in
            the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or
            place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint is
            without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.
          </p>

          <h4>Right to Data Portability</h4>
          <p>
            You have the right to have data which we process automatically based
            on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you
            or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you
            request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible
            party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.
          </p>

          <h4>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h4>
          <p>
            Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have
            the right to free information about your stored personal data, its
            origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing at any time
            and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data.
            For this purpose and for further questions regarding personal data,
            you can contact us at any time.
          </p>

          <h4>Right to Restrict Processing</h4>
          <p>
            You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
            your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose.
            The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us,
              we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the
              review, you have the right to request the restriction of the
              processing of your personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can
              request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
            </li>
            <li>
              If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the
              exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the
              right to request the restriction of the processing of your
              personal data instead of deletion.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO,
              a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long
              as it has not yet been determined whose interests outweigh the
              other, you have the right to request the restriction of the
              processing of your personal data.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these
            data – apart from their storage – may only be processed with your
            consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal
            claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or
            legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the
            European Union or a Member State.
